# Physarum Transport Networks

![Example](https://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/physarum/header.png)

This is a particle-based simulation inspired by the _Physarum polycephalum_
slime mold.

Details about the algorithm can be found on Sage Jenson's excellent webpage:

The algorithm is surprisingly simple given how complex its outputs appear.
That's the magic of generative algorithms!

## Usage

    go run main.go
